# Stealth Facebook

This integration adds support for Facebook bots within [Stealth](https://github.com/hellostealth/stealth).

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/stealth-facebook.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/stealth-facebook)

## Configure Your Facebook Page

To create your Facebook bot, visit the [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com) page. Full instructions are provided on the [Facebook Messenger Docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/) page.

When configuring your webhooks, you'll want to enable the `messages`, `messaging_referrals`, and `messaging_postbacks` web hooks like so:

### message_reads

Beginning with version `0.13.0` of this gem, `message_reads` webhooks are supported. When enabled in your Facebook configuration, they will appear as `current_message.read`. That will return a hash:

```ruby
{
  watermark: 1458668856253,
  seq: 38
}
```

More info about `message_reads` webhooks can be found in the [Facebook Developer docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/webhook-events/message-reads).

## Configure The Integration

```yaml
default: &default
  facebook:
    verify_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN'] %>
    page_access_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN'] %>
    setup:
      greeting: # Greetings are broken up by locale
        - locale: default
          text: "Welcome to my Facebook Bot."
      get_started:
        payload: new_user
      persistent_menu:
        - locale: default
          composer_input_disabled: false
          call_to_actions:
          - type: payload
            text: Some Button
            payload: some_button

production:
  <<: *default

development:
  facebook:
  verify_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN'] %>
  page_access_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN'] %>
  setup:
    greeting: # Greetings are broken up by locale
      - locale: default
        text: "Welcome to my Facebook Bot."
    get_started:
      payload: new_user
    persistent_menu:
      - locale: default
        composer_input_disabled: false
        call_to_actions:
        - type: payload
          text: Some Button
          payload: some_button
        - type: nested
          text: Developer
          buttons:
          - type: payload
            text: Restart
            payload: developer_restart

test:
  <<: *default
```

As with all Stealth integrations, integrations can be specified by environment. You'll want to replace `FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` and `FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your respective keys from your Facebook page.

These are the supported setup options:

### greeting
This is the message a user will see via Messenger before they have ever sent your bot a message.

### get_started
When the user presses the `Get Started` button in Messenger, the `payload` specified here is the payload that will be sent to your bot.

### persistent_menu
These are the items that appear in the Facebook Messenger drawer. You can specify menu items for each locale individually or use `default` to make the menu apply to all locales.

The `composer_input_disabled` disables the keyboard input. This is helpful if you anticipate all user replies will come from suggested replies. It defaults to `false` which means the keyboard input is enabled.

The `call_to_actions` list defines the buttons. In the above example, the production environment has a single button defined with the label `Some Button`. It's type is set to `payload`. The `payload` value specifies the payload that will be sent to the bot when the button is pressed.

In the `development` environment, there is a `Developer` sub-menu that contains a single button labeled `Restart`. This just showcases the ability to have sub-menus within the drawer. It's a common practice to introduce a `developer_restart` payload button in development so you can easily restart the bot.

In addition to the `payload` type, the persistent menu supports `url` and `call` type buttons.

### Uploading the Persistent Menu

Each time you make a change to the persistent menu, you will have to upload the change to Facebook. This integration provides a command line task to automate this:

```
stealth setup facebook
```

### Profile Data

By default, your Facebook bots may retrieve the `id`, `name`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `profile_pic` fields for users that have made this information public and have opted-in to your bot. More info [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/identity/user-profile).

To fetch a user's profile with `stealth-facebook` you can call the following:

```ruby
fb_profile = Stealth::Services::Facebook::Client.fetch_profile(
  recipient_id: current_user_id
)
```

`fb_profile` is a hash that contains the fields above:

```ruby
{
  'id'            => 1464633220279330,
  'name'          => "Carol Robbins",
  'first_name'    => "Carol",
  'last_name'     => "Robbins",
  'profile_pic'   => "https://platform-lookaside.fbsbx.com/platform/profilepic/?psid=1464633220279330&width=1024&ext=1537650777&hash=AeQzWeTgFqlAyiye"
}
```

If your bot has permission to retrieve additional fields, you can specify them as an array of symbols via the `fields` argument:

```ruby
fb_profile = Stealth::Services::Facebook::Client.fetch_profile(
  recipient_id: current_user_id,
  fields: [:id, :name, :first_name, :last_name, :profile_pic, :gender, :locale]
)
```

### Analytics

If you'd like to track custom bot metrics in addition to the ones provided automatically by Facebook Analytics, you can do so starting with version `0.12.0` of this gem.

In order to send these metrics, you'll need to include the `app_id` of the bot as well as the `page_id` of the Facebook page (attached to the bot) to `services.yml`:

```yaml
default: &default
  facebook:
    verify_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN'] %>
    page_access_token: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN'] %>
    app_id: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_APP_ID'] %>
    page_id: <%= ENV['FACEBOOK_PAGE_ID'] %>
    ...
```

Then to collect a metric:

```ruby
Stealth::Services::Facebook::Client.track(recipient_id: u.recipient_id, metric: 'name of your metric', value: 2)
```

You can specify additional options:

```ruby
Stealth::Services::Facebook::Client.track(recipient_id: u.recipient_id, metric: 'signup', value: 2, options: { 'fb_description' => 'A signup occured.' })
```

More info about events, such as which options are available, can be found on [Facebook's Events API docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/app-event-api) page.

## Replies

Here are the supported replies for the Facebook integration:

### text

These are standard text replies. It can sent like:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Hello World!"
```

Text replies can also include suggestions, which will be rendered as quick replies:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "What is your favorite color?"
  suggestions:
    - text: Blue
    - text: Red
```

Although not as common, text replies can also include buttons:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Would you like to give us a call?"
  buttons:
    - type: call
      phone_number: "+15552991212"
      text: 'Yes'
    - type: payload
      text: 'No'
      payload: 'No'
```

### suggestions

Though suggestions are not a reply type on their own, they are frequently used to optimize the accuracy and speed of your bot. In the `text` reply type above, we used simple labels for our suggestions. Facebook supports a few special types of quick replies, however.

#### Location

You can ask a user for their location:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Where are you located?"
  suggestions:
    - type: location
```

If the user chooses to share their location, the `lat` and `lng` will be available via `current_message.location`:

```ruby
current_message.location[:lat]
current_message.location[:lng]
```

#### Email

As of Facebook Messenger Platform 2.3, Facebook now supports a standard way to ask for a user's email:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "What is your email address?"
  suggestions:
    - type: email
```

The email address the user sends back will be available as the string in `current_message.payload`

#### Phone

As of Facebook Messenger Platform 2.3, Facebook now supports a standard way to ask for a user's phone number:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "What is your phone number?"
  suggestions:
    - type: phone
```

The phone number the user sends back will be available as the string in `current_message.payload`

#### Images

While images are not a special quick reply type, you can include and `image_url` for a quick reply as way of adding an icon to a quick reply button:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "What is your favorite color?"
  suggestions:
    - text: Red
      image_url: "http://example.com/img/red.png"
    - text: Blue
      image_url: "http://example.com/img/blue.png"
```

More info [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/quick-replies).

### buttons

As with `suggestions`, `buttons` are not a reply type of their own but are used to make your bot more efficient. Facebook supports a few button types and these are the ones currently supported by this integration:

#### payload

This is the most common button type. When a user presses a button that is `payload` type, that payload string will be sent to your bot. For example:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Please press the button below"
  buttons:
    - type: payload
      text: 'Press me!'
      payload: 'button pressed'

```

When a user presses the button labeled "Press me!", the payload `button pressed` will be accessible in bot via `current_message.payload`.

#### url

The `url` button is useful when sharing a link to a website. By default, it will open up within Facebook Messenger.

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Find out more via our website"
  buttons:
    - type: url
      text: 'Visit website'
      url: 'https://example.org'
      messenger_extensions: true

```

Enabling messenger_extensions allows your webview to access a selection of features from the Messenger platform. More info [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview/extensions?source=post_page). Without this parameter set to true, the webview opens in a separate tab or window if a user is visiting from the 'messenger.com' domain.

You can also specify the height of the webview window that opens up in Messenger via: `webview_height`. You can choose between `compact`, `tall`, and `full`.

More info [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webview).


#### call

The `call` button type will prompt the user to dial the specified number. The number will be pre-filled in, but the user will still have to confirm by confirming via the modal that is shown. To create a `call` button:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Give us a ring!"
  buttons:
    - type: call
      text: 'Call'
      phone_number: "+15552991212"

```

### Delay

Delays are a very important part of bot design. They introduce a pause between text replies to give the user a chance to read each reply. With this integration, in addition to introducing a delay, we will also send a typing indicator to the user to indicate another reply is forthcoming. To insert a delay in your bot:

```yaml
- reply_type: delay
  duration: 2
```

This will add a `2` second delay (with typing indicator). The `duration` can be specified as any floating point value, in seconds.

### Cards

Facebook distinguishes between a single card and a carousel of cards. This integration does not, however. You can send a single card the same way you would send 10 cards (the current maximum).

```yaml
- reply_type: cards
  sharable: true
  aspect_ratio: horizontal
  elements:
    - title: My App
      subtitle: Download our app below or visit our website for more info.
      image_url: "https://my-app.com/app-image.png"
      buttons:
        - type: url
          url: "https://my-app.com"
          text: 'View'
          webview_height: 'tall'
        - type: url
          url: "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-app"
          text: 'Download iOS App'
```

The above is a single card with two buttons. If you want to include more cards, though, you would just need to specify another listing under the `elements` heading.

The `sharable` and `aspect_ratio` attributes are optional. When `sharable` is set to `true`, a native share button is shown in Messenger for the message. The `aspect_ratio` attribute specifies the aspect ratio of the main card image (specified by `image_url`). It can be set to `horizontal` or `square` with the default being `horizontal`.

More info about Facebook cards [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/generic).

### List

A Facebook list is useful for displaying things like a news feed. You can find more info about Facebook lists [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/template/list).

To generate a list via Stealth Facebook:

```yaml
- reply_type: list
  top_element_style: large
  buttons:
    - type: payload
      text: View More
      payload: view_more
  elements:
    - title: Your Daily News Update
      subtitle: The following stories have been curated just for you.
      image_url: "https://loremflickr.com/320/240"
      buttons:
        - type: url
          url: "https://news-articles.com/199"
          text: 'View'
          webview_height: 'tall'
    - title: Breakthrough in AI
      subtitle: Major breakthrough in the AI space.
      image_url: "https://loremflickr.com/320/320"
      default_action:
        - url: "https://news-articles.com/232"
          webview_height: 'tall'
```

The list itself supports having a single button that will be rendered on the bottom of the list. Each individual list item supports having one button as well. List items should have between 2-4 elements.

In addition to the button, a list item can specify a default action. The default action is what will fired when a user taps the list item. A default action can be specified by setting the `default_action` attribute. The `default_action` should be configured as you would a `url` type button.

The image of the first item in the list is displayed as a cover photo by default. To disable the cover image, set `top_element_style` to `compact`.

### Images

To send an image:

```yaml
- reply_type: image
  image_url: 'https://example.org/image.png'
```

The `image_url` should be set to URL where the image has been uploaded.

Image replies support buttons and suggestions like text replies.

### Files

To send a file:

```yaml
- reply_type: file
  file_url: 'https://example.org/some.pdf'
```

The `file_url` should be set to URL where the file has been uploaded.

File replies support buttons and suggestions like text replies.

### Video

To send a video:

```yaml
- reply_type: video
  video_url: 'https://example.org/cool_video.mp4'
```

The `video_url` should be set to URL where the video has been uploaded.

Video replies support buttons and suggestions like text replies.

### Audio

To send an audio clip:

```yaml
- reply_type: audio
  audio_url: 'https://example.org/podcast.mp3'
```

The `audio_url` should be set to URL where the video has been uploaded.

Audio replies support buttons and suggestions like text replies.

### Account Linking

Account Linking allows you to invite users to log-in using your own authentication flow, and to receive a Messenger page-scoped ID (PSID) upon completion. You can find more info about Facebook Account Linking [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/identity/account-linking).

#### Login

The `login` button type will prompt the user to log-in using your own authentication flow in the case he or she has an account with your business. You can find more info about Facebook Log In Button [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/buttons/login).

To create a `login` button:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Log in to access your account information."
  buttons:
    - type: login
      url: "https://my-app.com/login"
```

#### Logout

The `logout` button type is used in the account linking flow to unlink the message recipient's identity on Messenger with their account on your site. You can find more info about Facebook Log Out Button [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/buttons/logout).

To create a `logout` button:

```yaml
- reply_type: text
  text: "Log out"
  buttons:
    - type: logout
```
